Introduction
============
Numerical integration is a powerful tool that can be used to simulate the
evolution of a wide range of systems. Given the initial conditions of your
particular system, ``spacejam`` numerically integrates your system using
pre-baked implicit schemes that are powered by automatic differentiation.

In this documentation, we outline the technique of automatic differentiation
and numerical integration, go through the implicit schemes included in our
library, and show some neat applications to astronomy and ecology.
