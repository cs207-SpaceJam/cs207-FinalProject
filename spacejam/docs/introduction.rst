Introduction
============
Our problem is to solve a system of equations given initial conditions of the
system. Our solution to this problem is to use Automatic Differentiation for 
machine precision computation of derivatives which can be used in the 
computation of Jacobians involved in implicit differentiation.

``spacejam`` will apply automatic differentiation to implicitly integrate 
the orbit of a low mass planet around a massive star.
