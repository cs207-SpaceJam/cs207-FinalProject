How to use ``spacejam``
========================

These following series of demos will walk you through how to differentiate a 
wide variety of functions with ``spacejam``

Demo I: Scalar function, scalar input
-------------------------------------
This is the simplest case, where the function you provide takes in a single scalar argument $(x=a)$ and outputs a single scalar value $f(a)$.

For example, let us take a look at the function :math:`f(x) = x^3`, which you can define below as:

::

        def f(x):
            return x_1**3 + x_2
